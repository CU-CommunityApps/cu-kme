    <p>Of the 76 new scholars, 55 will enter IU Bloomington with 15 enrolled at Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis, two at IU South Bend, and one each at IU East, IU Kokomo, IU Northwest and IU Southeast. </p>
    <p>The members of the Adam W. Herbert Presidential Scholars Freshman Class of 2011 have an average GPA exceeding a 4.0 (supplemented by advanced placement and honors classes) and an average SAT composite score of 1321, with a range of 980 to 1570. Almost all ranked in the top 5 percent of their class. Minority students make up 31.6 percent of the class; 58 percent of the new scholars are women and 42 percent are men. The gender breakdown in 2005 was nearly the opposite, with 39 percent women and 61 percent men. </p>
    <p>"The Herbert Presidential Scholars program continues to attract and retain the best and brightest Indiana students to each of our IU campuses," said Jack Schmit, director of Grant Procurement and Student Support at the IU Office of the Vice President for Diversity, Equity and Multicultural Affairs. "Students and families continue to be overwhelmed by the honor of this award and the support offered by the program." </p>
    <p>The program was created by President Emeritus Adam W. Herbert during his 2003-2007 tenure at IU and is considered one of the most prestigious scholarships for IU students. Originally called the Hoosier Presidential Scholars Program, it was renamed the Adam W. Herbert Presidential Scholarship by the IU Board of Trustees in 2007 to honor Herbert and his commitment to talented students from Indiana. </p>
    <p>Herbert Scholars are selected from across the state based upon exceptional talents, diversity, interests, outstanding academic records and strong leadership skills through school and community activities. Many Herbert Presidential Scholars have also overcome personal challenges and have shown great potential and motivation to succeed. </p>
    <p>Each campus will host individual welcome receptions for the Adam W. Herbert Presidential Scholars at the beginning of the fall semester, where students and their families have a chance to meet with campus officials and receive a new laptop computer. Students and their families will gather on the Bloomington campus for a university-wide reception and dinner in January. </p>
    <p>Herbert Scholars received a nomination letter from President Michael McRobbie in January, a letter from the campus chancellor or provost in February and a letter from the vice president for Information Technology in June. A letter from the vice president for Institutional Development and Student Affairs will be sent in August. </p>
    <p>The inaugural class of Herbert Presidential Scholars graduated in May of 2009. </p>
