    <h3>Lilly Library exhibit on 'The Music Man' accompanies Indiana Festival Theatre production</h3>
    <p><strong>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE</strong>
              <br>
              <strong>July 1, 2011</strong></p>
            <p>BLOOMINGTON, Ind. -- In June, the Indiana University 
Department of Theatre and Drama (within the College of Arts and 
Sciences) launched its inaugural season of the Indiana Festival Theatre 
with a large-scale production of Meredith Willson's <em>The Music Man</em>,
 the story of how love changes the lives of a fast-talking salesman, a 
small town librarian and the good folks of River City, Iowa.

   <p>Robert Preston, star of the original 1957 Broadway production of <em>The Music Man</em>,
 wooed his own small-town girl, winning the heart of Bloomington native 
and IU graduate Catherine Feltus long before his journey to River City 
began. The couple married in 1940 and maintained a strong connection to 
IU throughout their lives. 
</p>
            <p>In 2010, IU alumnus and Bloomington native Charles 
Leinenweber -- nephew of Catherine Feltus Preston and Robert Preston -- 
donated Preston's papers to the Lilly Rare Books and Manuscripts 
Library, along with photographs and papers belonging to Feltus Preston 
that are now in the IU Archives.
</p>
            <p>In conjunction with the Indiana Festival Theatre's production of <em>The Music Man</em>,
 Leinenweber, trustee of the Preston estate, brought additional 
Preston-related materials to the Bloomington campus, including Preston's
 Tony Award statuette for his performance as Harold Hill, to create 
three displays about his uncle and <em>The Music Man</em>. 
</p>
            <p>Leinenweber said he believes Preston would be thrilled 
about IU's production, and that the three exhibit cases (two in the 
Lilly Library and one in the lobby of the Lee Norvelle Theatre and Drama
 Center) will be of interest to anyone who enjoys Willson's great 
American musical and its original production.
</p>
            <p>The exhibit includes personal letters, photographs and 
memorabilia from the couple's lives and careers, including a backstage 
look into several original Broadway musicals such as <em>The Music Man </em>and <em>Victor Victoria</em>.
 The items will be on display in the Foyer of the Lilly Library 
throughout the run of the Indiana Festival Theatre production until July
 11.
